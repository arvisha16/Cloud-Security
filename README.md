# Cloud-Security

What is cloud security?
Cloud security refers to the safety guidelines, technology, and best practices used to protect sensitive data stored within the cloud from unauthorized access. 
When data is stored in the cloud, it’s stored on the servers of the cloud service provider (CSP) rather than on the user's local device.

The CSP offering the cloud service is responsible for monitoring and responding to the immediate security risks that threaten its cloud infrastructure. However, it’s a shared responsibility.

This means it’s up to users—whether they’re businesses or individuals using a cloud-based service—to follow best practices to protect their data in the event of data leakage or theft.
